# 3D-scene
How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? This project helped me further develop the skill to write code for lighting a scene. 
What design process did you follow for your project work? I used the structured design process to organize my work and to work through the project. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? One of the tactics that I used with this design approach was planning in the beginning. I knew that I needed to have functions and classes so that I could use my code for future uses.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I used the strategies from the incremental planning approach to developing programs. 
How did iteration factor into your development? After every new section of code I ran an iteration of my code to make sure that the code ran as I expected. If the code had errors I was able to correct them accordingly. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? Yes, I was stuck on milestone 5. Therefore I had to adjust my approach I was using to develop the code.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? As I have stated many times throughout this class, my goal is to make a virtual reality game for children with special needs. I will use the knowledge that I learned in this class to help advance my game and to make it the best that I can make. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? Graphics and visualization in this class has given me the opportunity to code in visual studio. I have also gained the ability to solve problems in many different ways. As well as look at things more critically.
